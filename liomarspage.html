    <p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio website</p>
    
    <p>You have seen our teams work over the semester and now you can learn a little bit
      about me!
    </p>
    
    <p>I was born and raised in Milwaukee WI, so obvouisly I am a big fan of the Green Bay Packers, the Milwaukee Bucks, and the Milwaukee
      Brewers. I may be from Wisconsin however I am not a fan of The Badgers for two main reasons: Go Hawks and I was denied admission when I applied.
    </p>
    
    <p>I am am an engineer at The University of Iowa. I am majoring in electrical engineering
      and minoring in mathematics. The University of Iowa was not my first choice for college however I was
      given the oppurtunity to attend with a full-ride scholarship.

      <h1>Hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy going to the gym at least four times a week.
        Weight lifting keeps me both physically and mentally healthy. I have been lifting consistently for about 2 years and have not stopped!
        <br>&</br>I enjoy playing video games during some of my free-time (if any nowadays). My favorite type of games are first person shooters (Call of Duty and Battlefield) or looter shooters (Borderlands, The Division, and Warframe)</p>
    </div>
    <div class="additional-row">
      <h1>Favorite food?</h1>
      <p>My favorite meal of the day is breakfast, specifically breakfast burritos. A big baby sized burrito to start the day just makes life so much better.<br>&</br>curd burgers. This one is pretty obvious of course since I am from the cheese state. Anything with cheese is an instant go to.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="additional-row">
      <h1>Pets</h1>
      <p>One of my pets is my dog Mac. He is a red nose Golden Retriever. He's about 12 years old but yet he is still full of energy and also full of random human food that he gets from my mom.<br>&</br>My other pet is my dog Lucky. He is a black German Shepard. He's about 6 years old. He is definitly much crazier than Mac but we all love him (sometimes).</p>
